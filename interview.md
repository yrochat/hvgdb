# Interview with HistoriaGames editor in chief

Here is a reconstruction of the email interviews of Mr. Aymeric Defrance.

## 8 October 2015

YR. How were the historical periods established?

AD. When I started to reference historical videogames, I decided to start with five main historical periods: Prehistory - Ancient History - Middle Ages - Early Modern period - Late Modern period. I used the basic division learned in school in order to facilitate understanding and research for a wider audience. Sub-categories then emerged to further refine the research. I would like to point out that the database also includes games dealing with mythology. »

YR. How were the historical events established?

AD. Since the vast majority of historical [video]games deal with war, it was decided to name these subcategories according to conflicts and wars. If a game deals with several conflicts, it will appear in several sub-categories. Games that do not deal with a war have not been subcategorized, except for a subcategory referring to games about Ancient Egypt. […]

However, for these categories to be established, they must include at least three games. For example, there is a category on games dedicated to the Anglo-Zulu war, in which we find three games, and another on the Texas Revolution (five games), but unfortunately there is none for the French Revolution, because there is, to my knowledge, only one game (Assassin's Creed Unity). Many conflicts have not yet been dealt with in videogames, hence the absence of their category on the site.

There is a separate category called All periods combined (I'm not sure how else to name it). It concerns games that go through historical periods from beginning to end, as is the case with Civilization, without dealing with a particular period. Nevertheless, there may be a scenario based on a conflict as is the case for Rise of Nations: Thrones & Patriots and its campaign on the conquests of Alexander the Great. In this case, the game is also in the relevant subcategory.

YR. How is the base maintained?

AD. [The database] is updated weekly [...] according to new announcements and releases.

YR. How was the database started?

AD. We started the database in March 2011. I spent nearly 6 months referencing the first 1400 historical videogames based mostly on the database of the Mobygames website, also collecting information directly from publishers and developers. The 300 or so other games added later were mostly new announcements and releases in the last 4 years. The database has very few early access games and it is rare to find a cancelled game. I generally prefer the games to be planned for release.

In addition to MobyGames, websites like VideoGameGeek, Jeuxvideo.com and Wikipedia have also helped me. Publishers' sites are also useful, such as Matrix Games’.

In the case of independent games, it is very difficult to keep an eye on everything. Either the developers use agencies that send out press releases – in this case it is easy to mention them – or they stay hidden or use Steam Greenlight to try to make themselves known. Unfortunately, it has become a bit of a mess on Steam to look for historical games.

We also keep an eye on Kickstarter in case we are interested in a game.

YR. How were the genres defined?

AD. […] I used the common classification as found on Wikipedia : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_video_game

## 26 January 2016 

YR. In the case of a videogame released on several platforms, how did you determine the release date?

AD. I always took the oldest release date […].
